- 👋 Hi, I’m @helloworld-html!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and design, though I still haven't worked on either professionally.(yet)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JavaScript, and I'd say it's really easy to get the two mixed up!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects that just need some quick checks, as I'm still not great
- 📫 You can reach me on other coding websites(I'll list them down here later)
